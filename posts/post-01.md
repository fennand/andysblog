## In 9th place (out of 9) we have - Sportpesa

So to start us off in 9th (and last) place, it is Sportpesa. From 2017 to 2020, the African gambling and gaming platform were the main sponsor. I found this a particular low point for us, I had taken some amount of pride in the fact we had not had to stoop to the lows of a gambling sponsor until now, but in true Everton form for this period in our history, the club let the fans down.

A bland sponsor, this also coincided with some truly ugly shirts from Umbro as well, the 2017/18 home being one of the single worst Everton shirts I can think of. The following season's shirts were OK, but the home and third from 2019/20 were also pretty terrible, though the Salmon away was nice enough. Put Everton in pink and I'm happy!
