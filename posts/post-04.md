## In 6th place (out of 9) we have - Danka

Danka. Main sponsors from 1995 to 1997, they were a US office equipment firm, something I didn't know until looking them up for this blog!

Looking back now, I quite like it, but as a teen at the time I couldn't take to it (as it sounds like another word . . . ). I remember regularly getting the piss took out of us for having this on our shirts!

Only present for two seasons, but every shirt it graced, including the goalkeeper shirts, were brilliant. Umbro were really on top form back around this time. There was some overlap back then, the 95/96 away featured with the NEC sponsor a season earlier, and the 96/97 away appeared with the One 2 One sponsor the season after.
