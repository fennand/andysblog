## In 5h place (out of 9) we have - Cazoo

Cazoo. Main sponsor from 2020 to 2022, they are a British online car retailer.

I was quite a fan of this sponsor, mainly because it was such an upgrade on the previous one (the loathed Sportpesa), and also because it was a bit of fun.

It coincided with Hummel taking over as kit manufacturer, which was always going to be a bonus for me. I'd been a big fan of Hummel since getting into shirt collecting, and I felt the last stint with Umbro had been pretty poor on the whole. I particularly liked the Away and GK home from the 2021/22 season.
