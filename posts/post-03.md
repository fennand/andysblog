## In 7th place (out of 9) we have - Keijan

Keijan, a Chinese electronics firm. Main sponsors from 2002 to 2004.

Despite having no clue who they were, I did quite like this sponsor at the time. I think it was probably the first time I had seen Mandarin on a football shirt! This partnership resulted in two Chinese 2002 World Cup internationals signing for the club, Li Tie being not too bad.

Most of the shirts from this stint were pretty unremarkable, all made by Puma. The 2003/04 third was probably my favourite, but the 2002/03 home also holds a lot of memories for me (Wayne Rooney wearing this sticks in the mind).
