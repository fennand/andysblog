## In 8th place (out of 9) we have - Stake.com

Stake.com, a casino and sports betting company. From 2022 to now. A disappointing return to another gambling company, made even worse after the club made promises not to use gambling firms again after Sportpesa. The Everton management disrespecting fans?? There's a shocker . . .

For those who are unaware, Everton must be the worst run club in the Premier League. Been mismanaged for years, the relationship between the management and the fans is broken, and the team is constantly on the verge of relegation.

Stake.com is a real let down of a sponsor, which is even more frustrating as the first set of shirts it has featured on have been great (you'll notice I'm particularly a fan of the goalkeeper kits so far).
