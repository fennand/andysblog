## In 4h place (out of 9) we have - One2One

One 2 One. The UK mobile telephone company were main sponsors from 1997 to 2002.

I thought this was pretty cool when it came out at the time, again I was a teenager then so having a mobile phone company on your shirt was pretty cutting edge!

Hilariously, on the fan version of the first home shirt featuring One 2 One, the sponsor pattern was printed upside down! Umbro then said it was the players version which was incorrect, meaning they did not have to recall thousands of shirts sold to fans . . .

Even though Everton narrowly avoided relegation on the final day of the season, that shirt has become a bit of a cult favourite since. At the time, it was deemed to be the wrong shade of blue, but it has its admirers now.

One 2 One featured on a few other cracking shirts, most notably for me the 97/98 away, 98/99 away, 00-02 home, 00/01 away, and another gorgeous salmon Everton kit (01/02 third).
